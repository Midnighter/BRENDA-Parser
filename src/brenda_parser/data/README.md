# Data File Descriptions

## [Information Fields](./information_fields.csv)

Comma-separated tabular data file that describes all the enzyme information
sections. Contains three columns.
 
| acronym | description | heading |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The acronym that begins a new specific entry within an information section. | A name for the information section. | The heading that introduces each information section. |
 
### Notes
 
* The descriptions were taken from the BRENDA download README and then
  corrected slightly since there are some mix ups. The headings were added from
  the download file itself.
* Please note that `ID` is a singular entry and has no heading.
* There is an acronym for general information `GI` but it does not occur in
  the download file and hence there is no heading.
